                These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Site or in 
                respect to the Site constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. 
                Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate 
                as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible 
                by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be 
                responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our 
                reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be 
                unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these 
                Terms of Use and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. 
                There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us 
                as a result of these Terms of Use or use of the Site. You agree that these Terms of Use will not be 
                construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may 
                have based on the electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack of 
                signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Use.
